      <p>
        As a Computer Science junior at Hunter College, I’m passionate about software engineering because it lets me bring ideas to life. From my first line of code, I knew this field offered endless possibilities. I thrive on the challenge of transforming ideas into finished products, finding satisfaction in overcoming obstacles, and continuously improving my work.
      </p>
      <p>
        My skills include Python, JavaScript, SQL, and frameworks like React, Node.js, and Flask. I’m also experienced with tools like Git, MongoDB, and Google Cloud.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m always learning, refining my skills through projects, algorithms practice, and staying current with new technologies. Let’s connect and create something amazing together!
